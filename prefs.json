There was somewhat of a frenemy relationship between Slack and Salesforce in the corporate collaboration communication space, with Salesforce's own Chatter product.

My feelings around Slack were that I did, to some extent, admire their model of viral onboarding and growth. Their method of onboarding and the frictionless way that they onboarded customers was something, I think, Salesforce could do better at as a business model, but I viewed them as a direct competitor. In a lot of opportunities, I worked with customers, I would hear their name used a lot in terms of how they collaborate internally, and Chatter lost a lot of the mindshare and didn’t turn into what it possibly could have been to be more of a threat to Slack, so the fact that Salesforce bought a company that had this amazing customer experience and a directly competitive product is not entirely surprising, although it is a little duplicative of what Salesforce already had with Chatter.",

Near term, due to COVID-19's impact on different industries, IBM and companies in similar industries face significant changes. The impact varies based on the revenue mix, with tech companies experiencing positive tailwinds from increased work-from-home technologies, while high-contact sectors face negative impacts. IBM's exposure is mainly to industries not heavily affected by COVID-19, such as public sector, government, healthcare, and telecommunications, which is positive. However, trends like work from home and digital-delivered services could impact IBM's labor-based business models, and supply-side constraints might affect customer acquisition in face-to-face sales. The overall near-term impact on IBM is moderate.\n\nLong-term trends are about the new normal and the acceleration of existing trends. Remote work and the pace of digital and cloud transformation are likely to accelerate, benefiting IBM's investment into Red Hat and hybrid cloud environments for large enterprises. This acceleration supports IBM's strategic path towards a more cloud and hybrid multicloud world. Conversely, there will be increased pressure on non-digital, non-cloud business models, challenging labor-delivered services.

The reason is that the major financial institutions, as well as the government and some big entity enterprises, will always have some important and highly confidential data stored in their private cloud. In the past, it was mostly stored on-prem in their most-secured data rooms and not on public cloud. Now, to continue to win their clients’ trust in the future, they will continue to hold my credit card information or those things more secure in their private cloud environment, which is less likely going to be intruded and penetrated through the firewall by hackers. Then, a lot of other computing workloads will be on the public cloud for ease of access by consumers and for peak shopping, holiday shopping demand, and all the other marketing brochures. It’s going to be a world where private cloud, public cloud and anything in between coexist. Based on my knowledge before I left IBM, we actually interviewed a few clients, and American Express or a few other financial clients told us they have at least eight different clouds they are working with inside and outside their company firewall. That’s called multi-cloud.\n\nTherefore, I truly believe that in the future, it will be a world of hybrid cloud, if we use hybrid cloud to subsume the concept of multi-cloud as well. The subtle difference between the two concepts is that essentially, at peak workload, you could burst some computing workload from private cloud, inside the firewall, to public cloud outside the firewall. In order to build such a conduit, that bridging state, that bridge, the public and the private cloud, I called it a hybrid cloud, now they use hybrid cloud for everything, basically, to subsume the concept of multi-cloud as well.",

My feelings around Slack were that I did, to some extent, admire their model of viral onboarding and growth. Their method of onboarding and the frictionless way that they onboarded customers was something, I think, Salesforce could do better at as a business model, but I viewed them as a direct competitor. In a lot of opportunities, I worked with customers, I would hear their name used a lot in terms of how they collaborate internally, and Chatter lost a lot of the mindshare and didn’t turn into what it possibly could have been to be more of a threat to Slack, so the fact that Salesforce bought a company that had this amazing customer experience and a directly competitive product is not entirely surprising, although it is a little duplicative of what Salesforce already had with Chatter.",

      "r1": "I would break down the themes into near-term trends, impacted by COVID-19, and long-term trends post-COVID. Near term, due to COVID-19's impact on different industries, IBM and companies in similar industries face significant changes. The impact varies based on the revenue mix, with tech companies experiencing positive tailwinds from increased work-from-home technologies, while high-contact sectors face negative impacts. IBM's exposure is mainly to industries not heavily affected by COVID-19, such as public sector, government, healthcare, and telecommunications, which is positive. However, trends like work from home and digital-delivered services could impact IBM's labor-based business models, and supply-side constraints might affect customer acquisition in face-to-face sales. The overall near-term impact on IBM is moderate.\n\nLong-term trends are about the new normal and the acceleration of existing trends. Remote work and the pace of digital and cloud transformation are likely to accelerate, benefiting IBM's investment into Red Hat and hybrid cloud environments for large enterprises. This acceleration supports IBM's strategic path towards a more cloud and hybrid multicloud world. Conversely, there will be increased pressure on non-digital, non-cloud business models, challenging labor-delivered services. The need for these services to become more cloud-ready and asset-based will increase, impacting IBM's Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, but overall, these are positive for IBM going forward.",

      "r1": "I believe all clouds in the future will become hybrid and multi-cloud and it wouldn’t be in purely public cloud. The reason is that the major financial institutions, as well as the government and some big entity enterprises, will always have some important and highly confidential data stored in their private cloud. In the past, it was mostly stored on-prem in their most-secured data rooms and not on public cloud. Now, to continue to win their clients’ trust in the future, they will continue to hold my credit card information or those things more secure in their private cloud environment, which is less likely going to be intruded and penetrated through the firewall by hackers. Then, a lot of other computing workloads will be on the public cloud for ease of access by consumers and for peak shopping, holiday shopping demand, and all the other marketing brochures. It’s going to be a world where private cloud, public cloud and anything in between coexist. Based on my knowledge before I left IBM, we actually interviewed a few clients, and American Express or a few other financial clients told us they have at least eight different clouds they are working with inside and outside their company firewall. That’s called multi-cloud.\n\nTherefore, I truly believe that in the future, it will be a world of hybrid cloud, if we use hybrid cloud to subsume the concept of multi-cloud as well. The subtle difference between the two concepts is that essentially, at peak workload, you could burst some computing workload from private cloud, inside the firewall, to public cloud outside the firewall. In order to build such a conduit, that bridging state, that bridge, the public and the private cloud, I called it a hybrid cloud, now they use hybrid cloud for everything, basically, to subsume the concept of multi-cloud as well.",

A recent Bloomberg article referenced\nAnthony Fauci discussing 75-80% vaccination take-up as the point at which the world starts to normalise. This\nseems likely to occur in the US at EOY 2021. Do you expect any structural changes to consumer behaviour that\ncould create a lag in parks attendance recovery in the US, and internationally where vaccine roll-outs may be\nslower?

You cannot actually trace any case of contagion to attendance to Disney theme parks or cinemas, so that should give confidence to people that they are a safe environment, provided that some measures are taken, both in terms of the parks and how people behave within the parks. The parks in the US, but also international, have such a loyal audience and consumer base, so I think they will come back. I don’t think that in relation to that there’s any permanent change in consumer behaviours. Maybe people will be slightly more considerate, maybe, and of course, the opening of the parks will be phased before you get to full capacity, so that will have an impact on the revenues, to some extent, until you go back to full capacity. I think it will be okay because of all these considerations. Again, I strongly believe that there’s no permanent change in consumer behaviours.",

Disney moved to this whole big brand tentpole strategy a little over a decade ago, having a Pixar film, a big Disney-branded film, a big Lucasfilm, a big Marvel film and having a few of those each year and maybe a couple of smaller films in between. That’s only sustainable if every one of those films is going to be theatrically released and is going to hit a certain minimum threshold as far as box office.

It also impacts the awareness of those films and the success of those films, even if people don’t see them.

The pioneering strategies of Salesforce in those early days were creating a marketplace for other applications to be built on the platform, and enabling a system of programming to allow not just the marketplace but the technology to make that easy to do so. Throughout the whole time, Salesforce puts a tremendous amount of effort and focus on their customers and their customer’s customer. Connecting their customers in new ways with emerging technologies has changed a lot over the last 15 years. It has always been unique at that time, of our customers being the stars of the story, whether you see them at the Dreamforce annual user conference, how Salesforce talks about their customers. It’s not about Salesforce. It is about their customers and their customers’ success and how they make their customers love them. That has been the consistent theme. Over the years, the technologies have changed over time. In the beginning, it was cloud computing, software as a service. Nowadays, they’re talking about blockchain, AI, invoice.",

Over the long haul, over the next decade, if you’re going to amortize it out, Mulan is going to do just fine, but that upfront, the whole theatrical release system right now is under great strain here in the US. Not as much in other places. People were upset in Germany, saying, “Hey, our theatres are open, we’re fine here.” COVID is being handled, the theatres are handling social distancing in a safe way, but right now, the only films that are being shown over there are European local films. None of the big films out of America are showing because they’re holding back, because of where the American marketplace is.\n\nI still think that this is going to be an interim thing and it’s probably going to take us well into next year. Things have not changed substantially here in the US except for opening up. Disney has a whole pipeline of films and they also have a nascent service that needs to continue to be relevant when you’ve got Warner launching HBO Max, Peacock out there, Netflix and Amazon Prime continuing to be aggressive in this space, and Disney also has to support Hulu, though Disney is not the sole supplier to Hulu here in the US.\n\nThe longer this goes on and the more that films start to go around being theatrically released, it’s going to affect the economics of the greenlight process of what types of films actually ultimately get made. Disney moved to this whole big brand tentpole strategy a little over a decade ago, having a Pixar film, a big Disney-branded film, a big Lucasfilm, a big Marvel film and having a few of those each year and maybe a couple of smaller films in between. That’s only sustainable if every one of those films is going to be theatrically released and is going to hit a certain minimum threshold as far as box office. Franchises can endure, even if the films might not be as critically received. The Star Wars films still make a decent chunk of change, even if people think that it’s not the greatest Star Wars film.\n\nYour stand-alone films have a harder go at it, and films that are at USD 30m-50m budget overall, those can be sustained probably better through going to a pay-per-view and a direct-to-consumer model, and not going through theatrical, but the amount of revenue that comes in at the front of the train from theatrical really helps feed the ability for these studios to produce these big, expensive, effects-heavy tentpoles. It also impacts the awareness of those films and the success of those films, even if people don’t see them. It has a downstream effect, because you didn’t see the last Avengers film in theatres, but you know that in a couple of months, you can go onto iTunes and rent it or rent it on Prime, or a few months later, it’s going to end up being on Disney+. You’re going to be more inclined, when you go into Disney+, to click on that big film for your family at-home movie night before you’re going to click on a lesser-known film that just went direct to consumer.\n\nIt depends on the marketing too. When Netflix has a big original film, and it’s with Steve Carell or with Tom Hanks, I’m only aware of those films from the marketing itself, but I don’t know how many eyeballs that’s necessarily driving compared to the success and the stature it might have had if it had a theatrical release. What’s in your news cycle every Monday morning? The weekend box office. The weekend box office is something that’s just part of our zeitgeist, it’s part of what we live and breathe on a weekly basis.\n\nWe’re all watching, we’re all prognosticating, we’re all looking to see what’s going to happen, and the studios are looking at how they can test models and stay viable and support their multiple lines of business that are very reliant on those films being released. Disney films hit consumer products, they hit the parks, they cross so many different lines of business, especially when they’re big franchise films. They are the catalyst, they are the engine.",

      "prompt": "(As of August 2020) What would be the key success factors for Mulan going direct to Disney+ to assess if this is something the\ncompany will do more? Do you think the bar is too high for the film to be NPV-positive when offered pay-per-\nview at USD 29. with subsequent release in some theatres? The original expectation was that Mulan would\nbe a USD 1bn-plus box-office gross-receipt tentpole. Is this just a squeezing-pennies exercise amid a tough\nenvironment?",
      "r1": "You’re having to amortize and make up your money over a longer period of time at lower price points. Over the long haul, over the next decade, if you’re going to amortize it out, Mulan is going to do just fine, but that upfront, the whole theatrical release system right now is under great strain here in the US. Not as much in other places. People were upset in Germany, saying, “Hey, our theatres are open, we’re fine here.” COVID is being handled, the theatres are handling social distancing in a safe way, but right now, the only films that are being shown over there are European local films. None of the big films out of America are showing because they’re holding back, because of where the American marketplace is.\n\nI still think that this is going to be an interim thing and it’s probably going to take us well into next year. Things have not changed substantially here in the US except for opening up. Disney has a whole pipeline of films and they also have a nascent service that needs to continue to be relevant when you’ve got Warner launching HBO Max, Peacock out there, Netflix and Amazon Prime continuing to be aggressive in this space, and Disney also has to support Hulu, though Disney is not the sole supplier to Hulu here in the US.\n\nThe longer this goes on and the more that films start to go around being theatrically released, it’s going to affect the economics of the greenlight process of what types of films actually ultimately get made. Disney moved to this whole big brand tentpole strategy a little over a decade ago, having a Pixar film, a big Disney-branded film, a big Lucasfilm, a big Marvel film and having a few of those each year and maybe a couple of smaller films in between. That’s only sustainable if every one of those films is going to be theatrically released and is going to hit a certain minimum threshold as far as box office. Franchises can endure, even if the films might not be as critically received. The Star Wars films still make a decent chunk of change, even if people think that it’s not the greatest Star Wars film.\n\nYour stand-alone films have a harder go at it, and films that are at USD 30m-50m budget overall, those can be sustained probably better through going to a pay-per-view and a direct-to-consumer model, and not going through theatrical, but the amount of revenue that comes in at the front of the train from theatrical really helps feed the ability for these studios to produce these big, expensive, effects-heavy tentpoles. It also impacts the awareness of those films and the success of those films, even if people don’t see them. It has a downstream effect, because you didn’t see the last Avengers film in theatres, but you know that in a couple of months, you can go onto iTunes and rent it or rent it on Prime, or a few months later, it’s going to end up being on Disney+. You’re going to be more inclined, when you go into Disney+, to click on that big film for your family at-home movie night before you’re going to click on a lesser-known film that just went direct to consumer.\n\nIt depends on the marketing too. When Netflix has a big original film, and it’s with Steve Carell or with Tom Hanks, I’m only aware of those films from the marketing itself, but I don’t know how many eyeballs that’s necessarily driving compared to the success and the stature it might have had if it had a theatrical release. What’s in your news cycle every Monday morning? The weekend box office. The weekend box office is something that’s just part of our zeitgeist, it’s part of what we live and breathe on a weekly basis.\n\nWe’re all watching, we’re all prognosticating, we’re all looking to see what’s going to happen, and the studios are looking at how they can test models and stay viable and support their multiple lines of business that are very reliant on those films being released. Disney films hit consumer products, they hit the parks, they cross so many different lines of business, especially when they’re big franchise films. They are the catalyst, they are the engine.",

      "r1": "I think there’s huge white space in India. It’ll probably never be e-commerce to the extent that China is, but we already have a pretty good business there and we’re investing more heavily in that market, not only for domestic transactions but also for cross-border transactions. India is not that big on exports, which is what our point in China is all about, but there is a robust import market. Indians like to buy from offshore. China is a white space, obviously. We bought GoPay, and we’re not a player in the domestic market. The GoPay licence was really intended to help us protect our CBT business, which is the third-biggest business in PayPal. It’s a huge business. The regulatory environment has changed. The Chinese government encouraged us to get a licence. Even though CBT was unlicensed space, they decided we needed a licence to continue operating in that space, and that the best way for us to get a licence would be to acquire somebody who had a licence. That was the main reason for going after GoPay. It also enables us to do business domestically as GoPay and with GoPay, and they have a number of customers there, but the question becomes how do you monetise domestically in that particular market? You’re going up against Alibaba and so forth, and they monetise like Facebook does. It’s all off of advertising. They pretty much give the payments away, and we don’t have a marketplace in China. How we solve that problem is yet to be determined.\n\nThen in developing markets, you mentioned South America. We do have a business in Brazil. We’re tiny in Mexico and Argentina, but when you look at the success of Mercado Libre, you’ve got to believe that there’s a good chunk of white space out there. We’re nowhere. With Mercado Libre, I don’t think we’re on their platform as a payment option, but PayPal has invested a lot of money in that business as an investment, and has done very well, and I think that’ll be part of PayPal’s strategy going forward, is strategic investments based on the company’s strong cash flow, free cash flow. Middle East, Africa, we’re nowhere, eastern Europe, nowhere, Russia, nowhere. Probably, through partnerships with people who have brand value with consumers and PayPal’s superiority on the merchant side can be a way to go after those markets in terms of international expansion.",

      "r1": "I’m a Slack user now at my current job, and I do have first-hand user experience with it, and it’s not exactly a Chatter replacement or displacement or competitor. There is more to it than that, and in many cases, some of the opportunities that Salesforce is better competitive positioning against Microsoft Teams. Microsoft has the ability to bundle Teams in with their other office productivity products as well as their CRM and their ERP. That was largely the model we had with Chatter. That’s where Slack may have been running into some headwinds as far as being a standalone competitor in that space. With it being part of Salesforce, it’s an easier story to tell, that it falls under more of a Customer 360 offering as a feature or an add-on that better positions Salesforce for competition against Microsoft. Then, longer term, Slack, their message has always been trying to put an end to e-mail. Whether or not Salesforce is really embracing that this time around, to really change the way communications happen, not just within an organisation but between organisations, which has been an ideal for Salesforce for some years. It would make some sense in that context why Slack would be a key acquisition to help them get there.",

      "r1": "I think there’s huge white space in India. It’ll probably never be e-commerce to the extent that China is, but we already have a pretty good business there and we’re investing more heavily in that market, not only for domestic transactions but also for cross-border transactions. India is not that big on exports, which is what our point in China is all about, but there is a robust import market. Indians like to buy from offshore. China is a white space, obviously. We bought GoPay, and we’re not a player in the domestic market. The GoPay licence was really intended to help us protect our CBT business, which is the third-biggest business in PayPal. It’s a huge business. The regulatory environment has changed. The Chinese government encouraged us to get a licence. Even though CBT was unlicensed space, they decided we needed a licence to continue operating in that space, and that the best way for us to get a licence would be to acquire somebody who had a licence. That was the main reason for going after GoPay. It also enables us to do business domestically as GoPay and with GoPay, and they have a number of customers there, but the question becomes how do you monetise domestically in that particular market? You’re going up against Alibaba and so forth, and they monetise like Facebook does. It’s all off of advertising. They pretty much give the payments away, and we don’t have a marketplace in China. How we solve that problem is yet to be determined.\n\nThen in developing markets, you mentioned South America. We do have a business in Brazil. We’re tiny in Mexico and Argentina, but when you look at the success of Mercado Libre, you’ve got to believe that there’s a good chunk of white space out there. We’re nowhere. With Mercado Libre, I don’t think we’re on their platform as a payment option, but PayPal has invested a lot of money in that business as an investment, and has done very well, and I think that’ll be part of PayPal’s strategy going forward, is strategic investments based on the company’s strong cash flow, free cash flow. Middle East, Africa, we’re nowhere, eastern Europe, nowhere, Russia, nowhere. Probably, through partnerships with people who have brand value with consumers and PayPal’s superiority on the merchant side can be a way to go after those markets in terms of international expansion.",

In HCM Cloud, Oracle initially acquired some vendors to provide solutions and integrated them, and they also have some solutions that are being developed. Additionally, there are other products that connect to it and are considered in the same vein, such as ERP [enterprise resource planning] or NetSuite.",

Do you agree with that sentiment? How should we gauge the\nmagnitude of the potential delays to IBM’s turnaround and transition process?",
      "r1": "It depends. CIOs are taking a cautious look at new discretionary IT spend. The impact varies by the size of the enterprise customer, with larger companies being more resilient. If a large enterprise has a strong balance sheet in an industry less impacted by COVID, their ability to undertake new projects or proceed with existing ones is high. This resilience is crucial for IBM, especially if its client base consists of large enterprises geared towards digital transformation, application modernization, and cloud transformation. Therefore, while there will be some impact on IBM due to a slowdown in the purchasing process, it’s considered moderate.",

      "r1": "I think there’s huge white space in India. It’ll probably never be e-commerce to the extent that China is, but we already have a pretty good business there and we’re investing more heavily in that market, not only for domestic transactions but also for cross-border transactions. India is not that big on exports, which is what our point in China is all about, but there is a robust import market. Indians like to buy from offshore. China is a white space, obviously. We bought GoPay, and we’re not a player in the domestic market. The GoPay licence was really intended to help us protect our CBT business, which is the third-biggest business in PayPal. It’s a huge business. The regulatory environment has changed. The Chinese government encouraged us to get a licence. Even though CBT was unlicensed space, they decided we needed a licence to continue operating in that space, and that the best way for us to get a licence would be to acquire somebody who had a licence. That was the main reason for going after GoPay. It also enables us to do business domestically as GoPay and with GoPay, and they have a number of customers there, but the question becomes how do you monetise domestically in that particular market? You’re going up against Alibaba and so forth, and they monetise like Facebook does. It’s all off of advertising. They pretty much give the payments away, and we don’t have a marketplace in China. How we solve that problem is yet to be determined.\n\nThen in developing markets, you mentioned South America. We do have a business in Brazil. We’re tiny in Mexico and Argentina, but when you look at the success of Mercado Libre, you’ve got to believe that there’s a good chunk of white space out there. We’re nowhere. With Mercado Libre, I don’t think we’re on their platform as a payment option, but PayPal has invested a lot of money in that business as an investment, and has done very well, and I think that’ll be part of PayPal’s strategy going forward, is strategic investments based on the company’s strong cash flow, free cash flow. Middle East, Africa, we’re nowhere, eastern Europe, nowhere, Russia, nowhere.

We mentioned two things earlier, one is the ramping up of production of content, with all the announcements in the last shareholder meeting between Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, but also, the decision of including in Disney+, all the non-family-friendly content that will be under the Star banner. I thought they would launch a second service for that content, like an international replica of Hulu. I think very wisely they decided it can sit within the same platform, they don’t need a second platform. Of course, they’ll increase the price at some point soon, but that was a bit surprising because up to before the launch of Disney+, the company was very rigid in terms of what they wanted under the Disney brand and what they didn’t allow under the Disney brand. Years ago, Miramax was part of Disney, and you would never mingle the two brands because the content Miramax was producing was not always family-friendly, they wouldn’t sit well under the Disney branding, similar to some extent with the Touchstone brand that got discontinued as well.\n\nBecause of that history, I was a little surprised that they decided to put Star into Disney+, but actually, from a consumer perspective, and for a long-term strategy, it makes perfect sense. If you want to compete with Netflix, which is the broadest possible streaming service you have, they have no choice of doing that because at this point, they don’t only appeal to the family audience but they appeal to the general audience as well. The same way Netflix has the opposite challenge, they appeal to the general audience and they want to appeal more to the family audience. That gives me confidence that even when we reach a point in which consumers will be discerning, Disney will be very well-placed to be considered as one of the few options that consumers will want to keep. The other thing that plays to the favor of Disney, Disney is being quite disciplined in limiting the availability of content outside of the platform, while other studios are being more liberal. Disney is quite serious about the strategy of, if you want Disney content, you need to have Disney+, and that clearly entices consumers to really adopt the streaming service because otherwise, they have no other chance to consume Disney content, which is so well-regarded and sought after.",

      "r1": "It depends. CIOs are taking a cautious look at new discretionary IT spend. The impact varies by the size of the enterprise customer, with larger companies being more resilient. If a large enterprise has a strong balance sheet in an industry less impacted by COVID, their ability to undertake new projects or proceed with existing ones is high. This resilience is crucial for IBM, especially if its client base consists of large enterprises geared towards digital transformation, application modernization, and cloud transformation. IBM’s portfolio, focused on large, resilient customers and digital transformation, positions it better than companies relying on small to medium-sized businesses. Therefore, while there will be some impact on IBM due to a slowdown in the purchasing process, it’s considered moderate, possibly lasting another 6-9 months, but not significantly affecting IBM’s transition process.",

I led a portion of the business where we would resell other hardware into our managed services accounts. For example, an account might need a bunch of Cisco, and rather than them contracting with each individual vendor, we would build it in, and even if we transferred ownership to the client, that became an in-quarter revenue. The other way to do it is to buy all that out, in this case, Cisco hardware, convert it to a service and charge it as a service and keep the capital on the books of NewCo, versus transferring it over to the client, but IBM actually did both of those models. The resale portion of it has been declining, but it was an important lever for short-term revenue into the business.",

Disney is quite serious about the strategy of, if you want Disney content, you need to have Disney+, and that clearly entices consumers to really adopt the streaming service because otherwise, they have no other chance to consume Disney content, which is so well-regarded and sought after.",
      "r2": "Expectations in terms of how many services families will be willing to join have increased. I think it’s partly a situation where you’re at home and you’re desperate to consume content. There will be saturation in terms of the consumers being confused about where to find what they want. I think that will be the evolution. However, it’s very clear there are some services that will be top of the list. If you get, as a family, to the seventh service and you’re unsure about the eighth, you’re pretty sure that number one and number two are either Netflix and Disney or Disney and Netflix. The numbers provided are showing a possible trend, but the actual number of streaming players that can compete in the long term is uncertain.",

For example, an account might need a bunch of Cisco, and rather than them contracting with each individual vendor, we would build it in, and even if we transferred ownership to the client, that became an in-quarter revenue. The other way to do it is to buy all that out, in this case, Cisco hardware, convert it to a service and charge it as a service and keep the capital on the books of NewCo, versus transferring it over to the client, but IBM actually did both of those models.

IBM's strategy is based on the premise that we are in the second chapter of cloud transformation, focusing on moving mission-critical workloads into the cloud. This involves adopting multiple types of clouds and keeping certain workloads on-prem due to regulatory concerns, data privacy, security, and the preservation of IT infrastructure investments. IBM’s thesis with Red Hat is to create a connected infrastructure that provides a unified management, security, and data platform across different cloud environments. This approach is accelerated by COVID-19 and digital modernization, benefiting large enterprises.\n\nRegarding the competitive landscape, AWS, Azure, and GCP have been primarily public cloud-focused. AWS is infrastructure and platform-focused, recently recognizing the need to support private cloud. Azure benefits from Microsoft's Windows legacy and its SaaS offerings, achieving significant growth. GCP positions itself in analytics and AI, despite being a late entrant. Unlike these competitors, IBM prioritizes a hybrid-first approach, aiming to support cloud anywhere without vendor lock-in concerning data or workload.

IBM's strategy is based on the premise that we are in the second chapter of cloud transformation, focusing on moving mission-critical workloads into the cloud. This approach is accelerated by digital modernization, benefiting large enterprises.\n\nRegarding the competitive landscape, AWS, Azure, and GCP have been primarily public cloud-focused.

We have big merchants in China, like DJI, the world’s biggest drone maker, and SammyDress, and the take rates are not so great with the bigger merchants, but with the smaller ones, you get good take rates. Then you charge a percent for a cross-border fee, and if they use your currency conversion capabilities when they bring the money back, you make a fee on that, although that’s under pressure due to a lot of alternatives now in terms of international money transfer and currency conversion. Your margins on cross-border transactions are probably 50% higher than on domestic transactions, and your take rates overseas are better than they are in the US, which is competitive.",

      "r1": "These entities can only ride so much on the global Disney hits, and those things have cultural relevance, some territories stronger than others. Having worked in international distribution with Disney for nearly 20 years, it was amazing to see the residence that certain Disney content has. There are commonalities when you look at the Marvel universe and even, to an extent, Star Wars. Some territories are stronger than others with Star Wars. From a regulatory standpoint in the EU, there’s going to come a time in the next year or two where every SVOD service is going to have to have, at any given time, upwards of 30% of their portfolio be local EU content. Amazon and Netflix have been either partnering with, acquiring, or even starting up their own production hubs across Europe. Disney has some production capacity in Europe, especially on the feature film side and traditionally the Disney Channel side, but there are other areas where they're more deficient and need to ante up. Disney also has a very prolific production hub out of Latin America, so they’re not going to have a problem with having local content in Latin America. There's a great affinity for localized content and local stories. Same thing with China and parts of Asia.\n\nI am more concerned in the near term looking at Europe, because there’s actually a regulation there that’s going to go into effect. In my experience and exposure within Disney, that’s an area where I feel that they're woefully behind. Eight months ago, there was so much attention on launching Disney+ successfully with the right content mix territory by territory, that they're now looking at how they were going to backfill to start getting some European-qualifying content.\n\nIt doesn’t necessarily mean that has to be a production that actually happens in Europe. The general guideline is it has to be staffed 50% in order to qualify as an EU production, so that could be above the line, below the line, the scriptwriter, or the star. You could have a European film shot in Arizona, but if it hits that 50% threshold, it can qualify as an EU film. Disney does a lot of their films out of Pinewood Studios in London, so there are a good number of their films that will already qualify as such. As for bulking out series and non-theatrical content, they might be more challenged in the near term.",

A portion of the business relying on legacy technology will remain under pressure. However, with Red Hat's integration, the long-term trajectory for GTS appears more positive, especially with strategic moves to reallocate investment, prune the portfolio, and introduce automation and cloud solutions to retain customers and compete effectively. The overall outlook for GTS is positive, influenced by Red Hat and COVID-related shifts, but dependent on the broader economic impact of the COVID situation.",

The common wisdom in the mid-2000s was no CIO ever lost their job purchasing Siebel, even if it was terrible, because it was the market leader. In the M&A space, particularly in marketing, and also in CPQ, there were a few standalone vendors, once we purchased ExactTarget, Marketo was left standalone. Adobe ended up buying Marketo a couple of years ago. There’s almost no standalone marketing automation company left. You either got big enough to be that trusted vendor, to be part of the standard application stack, or you got acquired or you went out of business.

Apsis was a tight partner, the earliest CPQ vendor in the AppExchange. Then, we made an acquisition. Apsis is, frankly, adrift. They’re not interesting enough to be acquired at this point, and they’re not big enough to sustain a significant competitive threat now that Salesforce has this in-house. There are always going to be start-ups and other technology companies that open new opportunities.

      "r1": "If you look at IBM, in the '60s and '70s, and through the '80s, IBM built its competitive moat as a technology company. It was predominantly hardware-based, mainframe-driven, so very differentiated, a lot of IP, a high margin. However, starting in the '90s, the mainframe-driven business model changed because of the emergence of the client server-based software. IBM went through difficulties in the early '90s as client server took hold, and that's when Lou Gerstner changed the business model of the company to a services-based business. This meant that the R&D and investment into traditional technology areas, like hardware and software, were not preferred relative to services, as services became the primary driver of the revenue growth through the '90s and early 2000s. However, this also meant that the core technology areas, like software, perhaps didn't get the right level of investment needed to keep them up to speed with the software industry. Then came the cloud in the early 2010s, which upended the business model of the services business itself. Customers increasingly recognized the economies of scale that cloud-delivered business brings, where they don't have to host their large infrastructure on-premises. This put a lot of pressure on IBM's businesses.\n\nWhat makes chapter two exciting for IBM is with Arvind Krishna now at the helm, a product software and technology leader, with a unique blend of technology and business acumen. With the Red Hat acquisition, IBM is going to put software, technology, and product again as the primary emphasis of the company, making significant investment around technology and software, and aligning the business model according to the market and where the competitors are. The real distinction of chapter two is the movement of mission-critical business, important workloads to a hybrid multicloud as opposed to the non-mission-critical workloads in public cloud only in chapter one.",

You either got big enough to be that trusted vendor, to be part of the standard application stack, or you got acquired or you went out of business. In the CPQ space, we bought a company called Steelbrick in 2015 or ’16, and that company became the foundation of configure, price, quote functionality that is part of Sales Cloud. Apsis was a tight partner, the earliest CPQ vendor in the AppExchange. Then, we made an acquisition. Apsis is, frankly, adrift. They’re not interesting enough to be acquired at this point, and they’re not big enough to sustain a significant competitive threat now that Salesforce has this in-house. There are always going to be start-ups and other technology companies that open new opportunities. In some segments, as they mature, they will consolidate with some of the largest vendors, or they will be left as a standalone point solution without a good story around a platform or a larger play.",

About two years ago, that organization was dismantled and international was bundled up with direct-to-consumer, so with a content and distribution engine. That leads me to believe that Disney is going to be extremely aggressive in every country to expand the presence of Disney+, and that is further confirmed by the fact that now Star is part of Disney+, and Star is a very big brand, particularly in India and Asia. That opens up a host of opportunities to them, because where the Disney branding is not particularly strong, they can play up the Star brand within the same platform. In my outlook before knowing that the Star brand was going to be included into Disney, I was imagining that they would have two international services and they would ramp up one or the other depending on the appeal of each brand, Disney or Star, in the countries. The fact that they’ve joined them simplifies that work and gives the opportunity eventually, to make sure that the Disney brand is as relevant as possible in every single market. In a market like China or India, where Star is more present, eventually, consumers will understand that it’s part of Disney and they can get much more out of Disney than just the Star brand, which might have been their entry point.

Netflix needs to do some work in defining who they are and how they want to be perceived and presented to the audiences, they’re not quite there yet, but we know they’re investing a lot in family content. One aspect that is interesting is sports. I’m curious about what the strategy in terms of sports will be for Disney.

That team, especially the consulting team of the GBS business, has invested quite a bit to bring in a lot of the tip of the spear capabilities to win the engagement for IBM, pulling in a lot of the lower layer of the stack-type products and services. Instead of having two separate sales teams intersecting with two different parts of the client’s organisation, it makes sense that all of that is together with a single-threaded contact through IBM services.\n\nGiven the size of the GBS and the GTS organisations, creating a joint go-to-market motion helps from a customer value prop selling standpoint, and also from a productivity standpoint from IBM. It's clearly positive and is aligned towards the IBM hybrid cloud-centric selling motions. Both GBS and GTS have Red Hat-related positives linked to their individual business models, but bringing them together helps with productivity improvement and the customer relationship.\n\nIn terms of GBS's growth focus, it is consulting-led and then sustaining the application management business. There may be opportunity for IBM to look at the application management business, especially the areas which are not significantly value-added and legacy on-prem, to shift allocation of resources and capital elsewhere and perhaps prune some sub-segments of that portfolio. Also, the Global Process Services, mostly around outsourcing customer service and HR businesses, is changing as customers move towards more software and SaaS-based management of those functions. IBM needs to think about capital investment and allocation going forward.",
      "r2": "I have seen some of those announcements and I think that’s a positive. GBS has been focused more around the applications, solutions, and industries, whereas GTS has been focused on the lower layers of the stack like infrastructures and platforms. Because of the journey accelerating towards digital transformation, cloud migration, application modernisation, a lot of the distinction between the solution and infrastructure is getting blurred. This means the business and solution focus from GBS and the infrastructure and platform focus from GTS need to come together. The Red Hat acquisition makes that point even more pertinent.

      "r1": "Thinking about the organization and the fact that international, up to three years ago, there was an international division called WDI, Walt Disney International, which was separate from the individual businesses. About two years ago, that organization was dismantled and international was bundled up with direct-to-consumer, so with a content and distribution engine. That leads me to believe that Disney is going to be extremely aggressive in every country to expand the presence of Disney+, and that is further confirmed by the fact that now Star is part of Disney+, and Star is a very big brand, particularly in India and Asia. That opens up a host of opportunities to them, because where the Disney branding is not particularly strong, they can play up the Star brand within the same platform. In my outlook before knowing that the Star brand was going to be included into Disney, I was imagining that they would have two international services and they would ramp up one or the other depending on the appeal of each brand, Disney or Star, in the countries. The fact that they’ve joined them simplifies that work and gives the opportunity eventually, to make sure that the Disney brand is as relevant as possible in every single market. In a market like China or India, where Star is more present, eventually, consumers will understand that it’s part of Disney and they can get much more out of Disney than just the Star brand, which might have been their entry point. There’s no real ceiling. If you consider how successful Disney has been to become the number one leader in theatrical distribution, in home entertainment, in parks and resorts, they have an opportunity to do the same now.\n\nEventually, the only contender really is Netflix, but Netflix has the challenge of redefining who they are and what they want to be for consumers. Before, they were this service that was providing the broadest range of content, but then when you start taking Disney out, Warner out, and Universal out, they can’t say that anymore, then it’s not very clear what Netflix offers. With Disney, you have a very good sense of what kind of content you will find on Disney. Netflix needs to do some work in defining who they are and how they want to be perceived and presented to the audiences, they’re not quite there yet, but we know they’re investing a lot in family content. One aspect that is interesting is sports. I’m curious about what the strategy in terms of sports will be for Disney. They have ESPN, a very established brand in the US, but they haven’t really made any progress in launching that internationally. The kinds of sports that ESPN broadcasts in the US have limited appeal internationally. I was paying particular attention to sports, because in the past, sports was always one element that was giving a competitive advantage, and it was interesting when Paramount announced the launch of Paramount Plus, they also said that sports would be featured in that. We’ve seen Amazon being more aggressive in sports, while the traditional streaming services, Disney+ and Netflix, don’t have a play in that space, but Disney could because of ESPN. It will be interesting to see if there’s a sports component that will show up at some point in the future.",

People feel safe with that approach, and it does make it harder for some smaller competitors to compete on that level, even if they might have functionally better products for that situation, because they’re not able to overcome some of those aspects of working with some of the leaders in the space. The common wisdom in the mid-2000s was no CIO ever lost their job purchasing Siebel, even if it was terrible, because it was the market leader. In the M&A space, particularly in marketing, and also in CPQ, there were a few standalone vendors, once we purchased ExactTarget, Marketo was left standalone. Adobe ended up buying Marketo a couple of years ago. There’s almost no standalone marketing automation company left. You either got big enough to be that trusted vendor, to be part of the standard application stack, or you got acquired or you went out of business. In the CPQ space, we bought a company called Steelbrick in 2015 or ’16, and that company became the foundation of configure, price, quote functionality that is part of Sales Cloud. Apsis was a tight partner, the earliest CPQ vendor in the AppExchange. Then, we made an acquisition. Apsis is, frankly, adrift. They’re not interesting enough to be acquired at this point, and they’re not big enough to sustain a significant competitive threat now that Salesforce has this in-house. There are always going to be start-ups and other technology companies that open new opportunities. In some segments, as they mature, they will consolidate with some of the largest vendors, or they will be left as a standalone point solution without a good story around a platform or a larger play.",

The fact that they’ve joined them simplifies that work and gives the opportunity eventually, to make sure that the Disney brand is as relevant as possible in every single market. In a market like China or India, where Star is more present, eventually, consumers will understand that it’s part of Disney and they can get much more out of Disney than just the Star brand, which might have been their entry point. There’s no real ceiling. If you consider how successful Disney has been to become the number one leader in theatrical distribution, in home entertainment, in parks and resorts, they have an opportunity to do the same now.\n\nEventually, the only contender really is Netflix, but Netflix has the challenge of redefining who they are and what they want to be for consumers. Before, they were this service that was providing the broadest range of content, but then when you start taking Disney out, Warner out, and Universal out, they can’t say that anymore, then it’s not very clear what Netflix offers. With Disney, you have a very good sense of what kind of content you will find on Disney. Netflix needs to do some work in defining who they are and how they want to be perceived and presented to the audiences, they’re not quite there yet, but we know they’re investing a lot in family content. One aspect that is interesting is sports. I’m curious about what the strategy in terms of sports will be for Disney. They have ESPN, a very established brand in the US, but they haven’t really made any progress in launching that internationally. The kinds of sports that ESPN broadcasts in the US have limited appeal internationally. I was paying particular attention to sports, because in the past, sports was always one element that was giving a competitive advantage, and it was interesting when Paramount announced the launch of Paramount Plus, they also said that sports would be featured in that. We’ve seen Amazon being more aggressive in sports, while the traditional streaming services, Disney+ and Netflix, don’t have a play in that space, but Disney could because of ESPN.

How should we think about tangible efficiencies\nthrough the combination of sales resources between those organisations?",
      "r1": "I have seen some of those announcements and I think that’s a strong positive. The reason for that is quite simple. GBS has been focused more around the applications, solutions, and industries, whereas GTS has been focused on the lower layers of the stack like infrastructures and platforms. Because of the journey accelerating towards digital transformation, cloud migration, application modernisation, a lot of the distinction between the solution and infrastructure is getting blurred. As customers look at a vendor like IBM, they’re looking for a solution that is geared towards enabling the customer to get better positioned in that customer’s own IT transformation. This means the business and solution focus from GBS and the infrastructure and platform focus from GTS need to come together. The Red Hat acquisition makes that point even more pertinent.\n\nThis translates into the go-to-market motion that management have pointed out. IBM has a very strong leadership team in place, Mark Foster, who has been leading Global Business Services for a few years now. That team, especially the consulting team of the GBS business, has invested quite a bit to bring in a lot of the tip of the spear capabilities to win the engagement for IBM, pulling in a lot of the lower layer of the stack-type products and services. Instead of having two separate sales teams intersecting with two different parts of the client’s organisation, it makes sense that all of that is together with a single-threaded contact through IBM services.\n\nGiven the size of the GBS and the GTS organisations, creating a joint go-to-market motion helps from a customer value prop selling standpoint, and also from a productivity standpoint from IBM. It's clearly positive and is aligned towards the IBM hybrid cloud-centric selling motions. Both GBS and GTS have Red Hat-related positives linked to their individual business models, but bringing them together helps with productivity improvement and the customer relationship.\n\nIn terms of GBS's growth focus, it is consulting-led and then sustaining the application management business. There may be opportunity for IBM to look at the application management business, especially the areas which are not significantly value-added and legacy on-prem, to shift allocation of resources and capital elsewhere and perhaps prune some sub-segments of that portfolio. Also, the Global Process Services, mostly around outsourcing customer service and HR businesses, is changing as customers move towards more software and SaaS-based management of those functions. IBM needs to think about capital investment and allocation going forward.",

It's a card played heavily in the sales cycle of one throat to choke from a commercial relationship, one place to go for supports, the leadership of company despite sheer size, and by its 21 years as a pioneer in the space, it de-risks a lot of the conversations. People feel safe with that approach, and it does make it harder for some smaller competitors to compete on that level, even if they might have functionally better products for that situation, because they’re not able to overcome some of those aspects of working with some of the leaders in the space. The common wisdom in the mid-2000s was no CIO ever lost their job purchasing Siebel, even if it was terrible, because it was the market leader. In the M&A space, particularly in marketing, and also in CPQ, there were a few standalone vendors, once we purchased ExactTarget, Marketo was left standalone. Adobe ended up buying Marketo a couple of years ago. There’s almost no standalone marketing automation company left. You either got big enough to be that trusted vendor, to be part of the standard application stack, or you got acquired or you went out of business. In the CPQ space, we bought a company called Steelbrick in 2015 or ’16, and that company became the foundation of configure, price, quote functionality that is part of Sales Cloud. Apsis was a tight partner, the earliest CPQ vendor in the AppExchange. Then, we made an acquisition. Apsis is, frankly, adrift. They’re not interesting enough to be acquired at this point, and they’re not big enough to sustain a significant competitive threat now that Salesforce has this in-house. There are always going to be start-ups and other technology companies that open new opportunities. In some segments, as they mature, they will consolidate with some of the largest vendors, or they will be left as a standalone point solution without a good story around a platform or a larger play.",

IBM’s key differentiation is its industry-specific solutions, such as the IBM financial service cloud, implemented first in the Bank of America and now expanding to other major clients. The former Chief Information Officer or the Chief Technology Officer of Bank of America was hired by Arvind Krishna, our IBM CEO, to be the SVP of multi-cloud or industry cloud, to bring those clouds into other financial service clients and maybe beyond. This is a key advantage that AWS doesn't have because they do not have enough industry knowledge. Azure knows the front office relatively well, but slightly lags IBM in back office industry knowledge. The number-one key advantage IBM has is their industry knowledge and the ability to reassemble all the cloud capabilities to package for the industry clients, specifically addressing their needs and workflow problems.",

A lot of their competition are not offering any of those different types of technology, or not as well advanced as Oracle is in that specific regard. The messaging every single time we’ve engaged when I was there, for the three years almost that I spent at Oracle with organizations, was always a surprise. “Yes, we’ve seen a Gartner report, but we just thought you guys bought your spot there. We didn’t think you guys actually had the most innovative product, or that you guys actually had a more competitive solution against Workday.”\n\nIt was restarting from the beginning with organizations, and going through those key points. Once we got into the product demonstrations, and we wanted to usually, at Oracle, home in on the strategic side of HR, Workday’s strength is just that global core HR, but what we would talk about is, “How many times have you lost an employee because it was difficult for them to update their address through the HR solution? Rarely or never, right? How many times have you lost people because they weren’t getting paid the right amount of money, or they weren’t getting recognized, or there was no clear path for them at that organization?” That’s the area that Oracle really wanted to differentiate on, is that talent management. They would talk about that and try to differentiate, and it worked fairly well.\n\nWorkday is a beast from a sales and marketing machine perspective, and they’ve put together a really good formula for how to win sales, and they tell a compelling story. They talk about their recent wins and mention, “You guys play in various spaces like retail, e-commerce, high-tech, and services, and all those companies we just talked about are Workday customers.” That messaging hits home. Before you even start getting into the product, the majority of the room has already bought in. Workday has done that really well, and I saw multiple times where Oracle would actually win out on product scorecards, but end up losing the business, not because of commercial terms, but simply reputation and overall perception of the organization. Some of that is what Oracle is trying to fix.\n\nThe final area that they saw a lot of objections around was customer success. While Oracle has made big trends and has this great new platform and has been winning a decent amount of logos, asking for customer references was difficult to do. In 2018, they announced the customer success manager model would be moving to a paid model, which hurt them in the overall messaging, and probably lost them more deals and more references.",

However, this raises challenges in managing financials since production is now disconnected from distribution, creating dynamics on spending without knowing the revenue generation, which likely requires oversight at the CFO level.\n\nIn terms of leadership, it is currently very solid with top executives in the industry leading content creation and Kareem Daniel heading distribution. The concern arises with the potential retirement of Alan Horn, a highly respected industry veteran crucial to Disney's studio success. His departure may leave a gap in talent relationships and leadership that isn't easily filled, highlighting the need for careful consideration on succession to ensure continuity.",

      "r1": "Thinking about the organization and the fact that international, up to three years ago, there was an international division called WDI, Walt Disney International, which was separate from the individual businesses. About two years ago, that organization was dismantled and international was bundled up with direct-to-consumer, so with a content and distribution engine. That leads me to believe that Disney is going to be extremely aggressive in every country to expand the presence of Disney+, and that is further confirmed by the fact that now Star is part of Disney+, and Star is a very big brand, particularly in India and Asia. That opens up a host of opportunities to them, because where the Disney branding is not particularly strong, they can play up the Star brand within the same platform. In my outlook before knowing that the Star brand was going to be included into Disney, I was imagining that they would have two international services and they would ramp up one or the other depending on the appeal of each brand, Disney or Star, in the countries. The fact that they’ve joined them simplifies that work and gives the opportunity eventually, to make sure that the Disney brand is as relevant as possible in every single market. In a market like China or India, where Star is more present, eventually, consumers will understand that it’s part of Disney and they can get much more out of Disney than just the Star brand, which might have been their entry point. There’s no real ceiling. If you consider how successful Disney has been to become the number one leader in theatrical distribution, in home entertainment, in parks and resorts, they have an opportunity to do the same now.\n\nEventually, the only contender really is Netflix, but Netflix has the challenge of redefining who they are and what they want to be for consumers. Before, they were this service that was providing the broadest range of content, but then when you start taking Disney out, Warner out, and Universal out, they can’t say that anymore, then it’s not very clear what Netflix offers. With Disney, you have a very good sense of what kind of content you will find on Disney. Netflix needs to do some work in defining who they are and how they want to be perceived and presented to the audiences, they’re not quite there yet, but we know they’re investing a lot in family content. One aspect that is interesting is sports. I’m curious about what the strategy in terms of sports will be for Disney. They have ESPN, a very established brand in the US, but they haven’t really made any progress in launching that internationally. The kinds of sports that ESPN broadcasts in the US have limited appeal internationally. I was paying particular attention to sports, because in the past, sports was always one element that was giving a competitive advantage, and it was interesting when Paramount announced the launch of Paramount Plus, they also said that sports would be featured in that. We’ve seen Amazon being more aggressive in sports, while the traditional streaming services, Disney+ and Netflix, don’t have a play in that space, but Disney could because of ESPN. It will be interesting to see if there’s a sports component that will show up at some point in the future.",

      "r1": "Thinking about the organization and the fact that international, up to three years ago, there was an international division called WDI, Walt Disney International, which was separate from the individual businesses. About two years ago, that organization was dismantled and international was bundled up with direct-to-consumer, so with a content and distribution engine. That leads me to believe that Disney is going to be extremely aggressive in every country to expand the presence of Disney+, and that is further confirmed by the fact that now Star is part of Disney+, and there is potential for it to be a big brand, particularly in India and Asia. That opens up a host of opportunities to them, because where the Disney branding is not particularly strong, they can play up the Star brand within the same platform. In my outlook before knowing that the Star brand was going to be included into Disney, I was imagining that they would have two international services and they would ramp up one or the other depending on the appeal of each brand, Disney or Star, in the countries. The fact that they’ve joined them simplifies that work and gives the opportunity eventually, to make sure that the Disney brand is as relevant as possible in every single market. In a market like China or India, where Star is more present, eventually, consumers will understand that it’s part of Disney and they can get much more out of Disney than just the Star brand, which might have been their entry point.\n\nEventually, the only contender really is Netflix, but Netflix has the challenge of redefining who they are and what they want to be for consumers. Before, they were this service that was providing the broadest range of content, but then when you start taking Disney out, Warner out, and Universal out, they can’t say that anymore, then it’s not very clear what Netflix offers. With Disney, you have a very good sense of what kind of content you will find on Disney. Netflix needs to do some work in defining who they are and how they want to be perceived and presented to the audiences, they’re not quite there yet, but we know they’re investing a lot in family content. One aspect that is interesting is sports. I’m curious about what the strategy in terms of sports will be for Disney. They have ESPN, a very established brand in the US, but they haven’t really made any progress in launching that internationally. The kinds of sports that ESPN broadcasts in the US have limited appeal internationally. I was paying particular attention to sports, because in the past, sports was always one element that was giving a competitive advantage, and it was interesting when Paramount announced the launch of Paramount Plus, they also said that sports would be featured in that. We’ve seen Amazon being more aggressive in sports, while the traditional streaming services, Disney+ and Netflix, don’t have a play in that space, but Disney could because of ESPN. It will be interesting to see if there’s a sports component that will show up at some point in the future.",

      "r1": "When other companies increase their focus on hybrid architecture, the advantage Red Hat and IBM have comes from the fact that Red Hat, because of Red Hat OpenShift and its Linux operating system, is significantly ahead of the market in offering an open, vendor-neutral, hybrid operating environment, which has significant customer trust. This is a competitive advantage for IBM through the combination of Rails and OpenShift and associated products like Ansible and CloudForms. The ability to support cloud-native application deployment, development, and delivery across various infrastructures, and the trust in the Red Hat and OpenShift ecosystem for supporting no vendor lock-in, is significant. This is a significant advantage for Red Hat and IBM. Google, while having a reputation for supporting the open community, is relatively new to the enterprise infrastructure ecosystem, which is a disadvantage. IBM is unique in having hardware or infrastructure, software or solutions, and services as primary lines of revenue-generating businesses, unlike its competitors. This differentiates IBM, as it can provide solutions that integrate its own technologies and services.\n\nA potential risk for IBM is the challenge of focusing adequately across all competitive segments – software, disruptive technologies, new talent, artificial intelligence, and services – at the same rate and pace as their competitors like Google, AWS, and system integrators focused on industry domain and labor.",

Sometimes Salesforce plays defensive in markets they don’t either create or lead.

Salesforce acquired a company called Heroku, dedicated to custom application platforms and the ability to provision software services for a more developer focus. Heroku has had some success, but it is not as well known as AWS. This is an example where Salesforce has been successful but also shows a necessary posture for Salesforce given the eminence of Amazon moving into that space.

I think it’s fair to say\nthat Customer 360 is unwieldy, with so many different applications and data and content types. Do you think\nSlack will make much difference? Is the platform interface and usability a key issue?",
      "r1": "The Customer 360 vision is a sound one, putting the customer at the center of your business to understand their inclination to purchase, their need for support, your brand, your marketing, and what that customer says about you as a vendor are all really important. Salesforce’s vision is to stitch these things together so that data isn’t siloed, allowing everyone to see across all those interactions, touchpoints, and sentiments in one application, being Salesforce and the platform and the Customer 360 view. It’s been challenging to stitch together, and some of these acquisitions, especially when they’re not native to the core Force platform, sometimes they don’t look and feel the same way as Salesforce, and that’s an ongoing challenge. Having a common interface like Slack, that does a better job of tying these together in a more uniform way and providing a more seamless experience to the end user and their end customer, is part of the vision here. \n\nI have trouble making the connection between how Slack would do this any differently than the attempts Salesforce has made before. This Customer 360 vision has been going for years, and it’s the right thing for enterprise software buyers, but the actual execution is tough. There are disconnects between the products today that Salesforce has, and whether Slack will be able to tie that better, in a more seamless way than Salesforce has been working on for a number of years, I don’t know.",

Oracle shifted from an M&A model to building everything in-house on one code line to match and outdo Workday. SAP, after acquiring SuccessFactors, pursued a \"best in breed\" strategy, not focusing on a single code line but rather integrating the best applications in various areas under one umbrella.

Ultimate Software, more known in the mid-market and small enterprise sector, focused on payroll as their differentiator but also developed a compelling story around core and talent management products. Ultimate executed well with in-house professional services. Kronos, known for workforce management, partnered with Ultimate, enhancing their combined offerings.

Oracle shifted from an M&A model to building everything in-house on one code line to match and outdo Workday. SAP, after acquiring SuccessFactors, pursued a \"best in breed\" strategy, not focusing on a single code line but rather integrating the best applications in various areas under one umbrella. Despite being a full SAP shop, some organizations would eliminate SAP early in the selection process due to its product being perceived as lagging and not having the best user experience. Ultimate Software, more known in the mid-market and small enterprise sector, focused on payroll as their differentiator but also developed a compelling story around core and talent management products. Ultimate executed well with in-house professional services. Kronos, known for workforce management, partnered with Ultimate, enhancing their combined offerings. Other vendors like Infor, Cornerstone-Saba, and ADP were occasionally considered, mainly for specific functionalities rather than full-suite capabilities. The competition typically involved the big three for large enterprises, with Ultimate, Ceridian, and others appearing in discussions for mid-market or smaller enterprises.",

This could actually be an interesting opportunity of cost savings, because the majority of those cloud resources were required to come from IBM. This was not an area that you did a lot of subcontracting, and there may be cost efficiencies that you could gain by using some other subcontractor in the area of cloud. The other thing that might also open up is the ability to have a larger percentage of spend through minority partners. Typically, these contracts also have, when you go to win them, some percentage to have to go through minority suppliers, and this may open up an opportunity to compete with those subcontractors, more of which are minority owned and compete better.

Oracle shifted from an M&A model to building everything in-house on one code line to match and outdo Workday. SAP, after acquiring SuccessFactors, pursued a \"best in breed\" strategy, not focusing on a single code line but rather integrating the best applications in various areas under one umbrella. Despite being a full SAP shop, some organizations would eliminate SAP early in the selection process due to its product being perceived as lagging and not having the best user experience. Ultimate Software, more known in the mid-market and small enterprise sector, focused on payroll as their differentiator but also developed a compelling story around core and talent management products. Ultimate executed well with in-house professional services. Kronos, known for workforce management, partnered with Ultimate, enhancing their combined offerings. Other vendors like Infor, Cornerstone-Saba, and ADP were occasionally considered, mainly for specific functionalities rather than full-suite capabilities. The competition typically involved the big three for large enterprises, with Ultimate, Ceridian, and others appearing in discussions for mid-market or smaller enterprises.",

      "r1": "In the early years, Oracle primarily won contracts based on commercial terms, offering significantly lower costs and flexible payment options, unlike Workday. Oracle's product became more competitive around 2016-17, winning more deals by highlighting interoperability between Oracle solutions, shifting the focus from just HR to a full back office platform. By the early part of 2018, Oracle became more competitive in talent management, a known weakness for Workday, leading to wins in several deals by focusing on talent management and matching or beating Workday's total cost.\n\nOracle lost contracts due to its reputation and complex implementation process, which worked against it when organizations sought simpler solutions, like Workday's out-of-the-box process. Despite scoring higher in product evaluations and being preferred by IT, HR, and procurement for security and commercial terms, Oracle sometimes lost to Workday due to Workday's brand recognition, ties or connections with CHROs or CFOs, or their competitors' use of Workday.",

Disney+ is already outperforming the subscriber growth they projected in the first year, which were modest because they weren't sure about the technology or marketplace reception. Some of it is banked into that, but the exact answer is something the finance teams have been grappling with. When licensing internally, you need to ensure you're licensing at market value to avoid criticism from guilds, unions, and talent. A lot of it is looking at the long game.",

Is that a function of less brand affinity for the FX content outside the US\nso much as Disney being conservative in its pricing strategies? Do you expect those two to come to parity,\nwhere the Star value prop will be driven up to that USD 12 per month or so over the next few years?",
      "r1": "Disney is being aggressive to get as many subscribers as possible for two reasons. One, because they want to reach their objectives in terms of the number of people they reach, and also because there’s a great value in every subscriber in terms of lifetime value that the consumer will bring to the service and to the company. They’re being very aggressive in terms of pricing, and little by little, they will ramp up and become similar to other offerings. I don’t know what considerations Disney in particular has, but I’m not surprised that some other services have not been as quick in terms of increasing their consumer base because of pricing, and HBO Max is an example. At launch, it was priced too high, and now, maybe with the theatrical content coming in, it becomes more acceptable. If a consumer is very discerning and starts understanding how much they’re spending on the service compared to how much they would have spent by going to the cinema and all the other things, then all these services are extremely cheap. Disney has been particularly aggressive, initially given the more limited library of content they had, but now that that is increasing and it will increase over time, I think prices will go up until some level of parity, maybe not complete parity, but some level of parity with Netflix, for example, or other similar services. I consider Apple and Amazon Prime are different, there’s a different proposition there, so I don’t know that they compete in the same set of competitors.",

In terms of Marvel, Star Wars, etc, these do well in those markets.\n\nWhen you think about originals, consider LATAM and some eastern European countries. High Disney affinity exists in certain LATAM countries, but to be successful from a streaming perspective, investing in local talent is crucial so that original content reflects the local community. Investing in local content, while costly and potentially not monetizable in other countries, is necessary for broadening their market. \n\nIn India, leveraging the acquisition of Hotstar, the largest TV provider, to build brand awareness and investing in local talents and affinities, such as Bollywood content, can contribute to growth.

      "r1": "The Pay in 4 product is a me-too product. You pay 25% on the date of purchase and then 25% each two weeks. Afterpay's merchant acquisition strategy was geared toward a particular demographic, going after fashion and accessory retailers who were already integrated with PayPal. Consequently, the consumer starts the shopping experience on the Afterpay app, unlike PayPal, where the shopping experience ends with the option to use PayPal for payment. PayPal is unlikely to become the starting point in a consumer's purchasing journey like Afterpay. Although PayPal's new product doesn't charge an additional fee to merchants, which contrasts with Afterpay's monetization strategy through charging fees, it primarily serves to prevent PayPal from losing ground rather than creating significant differentiation; it's essentially a catch-up move.\n\nYounger demographics are increasingly avoiding traditional credit products, preferring to spend their own money. Afterpay, resembling a debit product without interest charges, appeals to this demographic, especially for fashion and accessories. PayPal's introduction of the Pay in 4 product, which is being rolled out aggressively, represents a good move to adapt to these trends.

This event attracts people from all industries and lines of business, offering a forum for career advancement and philanthropy, which acts as a well-executed marketing engine. Salesforce also excels in attracting top talent, which is an important part of its marketing. However, weaknesses include prematurely hyping services before they are ready, leading to challenges for salespeople. Additionally, maintaining top-line growth relies heavily on acquisitions, which can be clunky and make messaging difficult to absorb.

      "r1": "The Pay in 4 product is a me-too product. You pay 25% on the date of purchase and then 25% each two weeks. Afterpay's merchant acquisition strategy was geared toward a particular demographic, going after fashion and accessory retailers who were already integrated with PayPal. Consequently, the consumer starts the shopping experience on the Afterpay app, unlike PayPal, where the shopping experience ends with the option to use PayPal for payment. PayPal is unlikely to become the starting point in a consumer's purchasing journey like Afterpay. Although PayPal's new product doesn't charge an additional fee to merchants, which contrasts with Afterpay's monetization strategy through charging fees. It primarily serves to prevent PayPal from losing ground rather than creating significant differentiation; it's essentially a catch-up move. Afterpay, resembling a debit product without interest charges, appeals to this demographic, especially for fashion and accessories. PayPal's introduction of the Pay in 4 product, which is being rolled out aggressively, represents a good move to adapt to these trends. Initially, it was hard to find on merchant sites, but now it's becoming more widely available.",

      "prompt": "(As of February 2021) Is achieving a USD 15 Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by 2024 for Disney+ likely through annual USD 2 price increases, or do you anticipate bundling updates and new content inclusion as the main drivers, particularly considering the potential impact on subscriber growth?",
      "r1": "It’s the power of the brand and its premium content, so people might not be very upset about that. The bundling point is interesting because they're not bundling, they're included, which is a different thing. Instead of having a Disney service at USD 9 and a Star service at USD 7 or USD 9 and you bundle it at USD 14, you will have the two together not bundled but for USD 14 eventually. People might not be upset about the increased price the first time because they will see how much more content is available to them. Because they’re enjoying the content so much, maybe the second time they will think a little bit. In 2019, Disney had a share of box office, most people go to see a Disney movie in cinemas. Now, they have the choice of enjoying all that content relatively cheaply in the comfort of their houses. When consumers think about that and if Disney helps them thinking about that in those terms, then the price is no issue. Given the loyalty, the affinity, the power of the brand, they can push it at some point. Not now because they want to increase the number of subscribers, but at some point. Historically, Disney has been premium price all the time on everything.",

      "r1": "Yes, I imagine it will be. At that point, they will have the full range of content and library of all the partners that they have, all of the brands. It makes sense. The output of Disney will rival the output of Netflix, maybe not in quantity, but for sure in quality and appeal for the audiences. The growth will come not only by increasing the number of subscriptions but also increasing the prices. There’s another thing that will have to come into place, which is the fact that Disney, more than anyone else, will be able to use their subscribers as a captive audience to sell them something more. Disney is so powerful in terms of merchandising sales and theme parks and cruises, and so far, they’ve been inefficient in capturing revenues from those businesses. They don’t have to find consumers anymore, they have them, they know everything about these people, they are the subscribers. I wouldn’t be surprised that the experiment of charging an extra price for certain content on Disney+ will become the opportunity to upsell to the audience subscribed into Disney+ something else, whether it’s a plush for the kids or whatever it is. Given that the Disney businesses are managed in an integrated way, helping each other out, I wouldn’t be surprised that the direct-to-consumer approach through Disney+ and outside of Disney+ will determine growth for the company overall.",

      "r1": "The Pay in 4 product is a me-too product. You pay 25% on the date of purchase and then 25% each two weeks. Afterpay's merchant acquisition strategy was geared toward a particular demographic, going after fashion and accessory retailers who were already integrated with PayPal. Consequently, the consumer starts the shopping experience on the Afterpay app, unlike PayPal, where the shopping experience ends with the option to use PayPal for payment. PayPal is unlikely to become the starting point in a consumer's purchasing journey like Afterpay. Although PayPal's new product doesn't charge an additional fee to merchants, which contrasts with Afterpay's monetization strategy through charging fees, it primarily serves to prevent PayPal from losing ground rather than creating significant differentiation; it's essentially a catch-up move.\n\nYounger demographics are increasingly avoiding traditional credit products, preferring to spend their own money. Afterpay, resembling a debit product without interest charges, appeals to this demographic, especially for fashion and accessories. PayPal's introduction of the Pay in 4 product, which is being rolled out aggressively, represents a good move to adapt to these trends. Initially, it was hard to find on merchant sites, but now it's becoming more widely available.",

Could you quantify the growth potential for NewCo?",
      "r1": "One area of potential growth for IBM's NewCo will be to increase services around the cloud. The other growth area would be to target mid-size companies, as most of these organizations still have on-prem services and weren't necessarily considering IBM. There is a growth opportunity to compete with offshore vendors, especially considering the risks associated with COVID and no international travel, and to bring operations back onshore, or at least a portion. The challenge with workers on immigration status not being able to be onshore anymore presents a significant opportunity to grow an onshore business and reduce the risk associated with offshore operations.",

      "prompt": "(As of January 2021) When you started at Salesforce, did you feel like the company had a world-class calibre sales organisation\nor was it gradually built up and developed? You were there for a long time. Did it start with a set of principles\nwhich were simply executed, or was it gradual evolution and knowledge, culminating in this organisation\nwhich I think many people consider to be exemplary in the industry?",
      "r1": "I’m going into the way-back machine here a little, but I think the first book that Marc wrote was called Behind the Cloud, and it had to do with the formation of Salesforce and the early years. I think the book came out somewhere 2008 or 2010, something like that. In that book, for anyone who’s interested in reading it, you will see the blueprint for the sales model for Salesforce, and it was quite different. Yes, it’s evolved, but it started out with a very different perspective on how to sell the product. Salesforce’s DNA was building out, was customer success breeds success. Successful customers, good, referenceable stories, putting people together at events like Dreamforce where they could all meet each other. We weren’t hiding failure. In fact, if anything, we wanted to address it and make things better and make sure our customers knew it so there was a very high referral rate, a very high CSAT, and we used reference selling and selling by storytelling very effectively in the early days.

      "r1": "You don’t know. There isn't a mathematical equation by market to say what they’ll need, but they won’t know until they start feeding that machine and seeing what works. For example, looking at India, Indonesia and the Bollywood content, there have been a handful of really successful Bollywood crossovers, or the engagement and interest in the US for Bollywood content. As they produce local content specifically for the Indian market, which might be a lot cheaper to produce and the quality, the production might not need to be as high because you don’t need a lot of special effects or post-production, it really is just about the actors and the story and some simple sets and on-location sets. To the extent that a few of those can cross over and translate and hit here, where they could use that content to feed the US Disney+ machine, or even put some of that on Hulu, that’s great because the more they can monetise these productions across market, then that helps them for profitability. Similarly, with the Latin American content they’re looking to produce as well, that’s a machine they might have to feed a bit more, I don’t know the cadence, but have more in the pipeline to feed it because Brazil, Mexico, etc., are definitely communities that want to reflect their culture. \n\nCanada is another big opportunity and the numbers there, we, on large part, tend to treat them like the US, but they’re not, and they have their own needs and community as well. Not so much for local content, but if you could pay attention to some of the library content that you have that is driven by Canada talent, that doesn’t really cost a lot of money, but to appeal to them and just start to make them understand that we know you, we get you, you’re not just part of the US. Yes, India, Latin America, even potentially some of the European markets as well, whether that’s France, maybe Italy, but I would say France more so, maybe Germany. You’re seeing, if you look at the Netflix side of the house, they do a great job of creating some locally produced content that they offer and promote in the States that people are curious about. They do a great job of telling me what’s new. Even if I don’t have any interest in ever watching it, they’ve trained my brain, the value that I get for my USD 12.-13. a month is pretty high, even if I never watch it.

Similarly, with the Latin American content they’re looking to produce as well, that’s a machine they might have to feed a bit more, I don’t know the cadence, but have more in the pipeline to feed it because various countries are communities that want to reflect their culture.",

      "prompt": "(As of March 2021) How can Disney estimate the profitability of markets for Disney+ based on local content needs, and how might international expansion impact its streaming profit and loss, considering variables such as Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), content frequency requirements, and the comparison of markets like Bollywood to the US in terms of content valuation?",
      "r1": "You don’t know. There isn't a mathematical equation by market to say what they’ll need, but they won’t know until they start feeding that machine and seeing what works. For example, looking at India, Indonesia and the Bollywood content, there have been a handful of really successful Bollywood crossovers, or the engagement and interest in the US for Bollywood content. As they produce local content specifically for the Indian market, which might be a lot cheaper to produce and the quality, the production might not need to be as high because you don’t need a lot of special effects or post-production, it really is just about the actors and the story and some simple sets and on-location sets. To the extent that a few of those can cross over and translate and hit here, where they could use that content to feed the US Disney+ machine, or even put some of that on Hulu, that’s great because the more they can monetise these productions across market, then that helps them for profitability. Similarly, with the Latin American content they’re looking to produce as well, that’s a machine they might have to feed a bit more, I don’t know the cadence, but have more in the pipeline to feed it because Brazil, Mexico, etc., are definitely communities that want to reflect their culture. \n\nCanada is another big opportunity and the numbers there, we, on large part, tend to treat them like the US, but they’re not, and they have their own needs and community as well. Not so much for local content, but if you could pay attention to some of the library content that you have that is driven by Canada talent, that doesn’t really cost a lot of money, but to appeal to them and just start to make them understand that we know you, we get you, you’re not just part of the US. Yes, India, Latin America, even potentially some of the European markets as well, whether that’s France, maybe Italy, but I would say France more so, maybe Germany. You’re seeing, if you look at the Netflix side of the house, they do a great job of creating some locally produced content that they offer and promote in the States that people are curious about. They do a great job of telling me what’s new. Even if I don’t have any interest in ever watching it, they’ve trained my brain, the value that I get for my USD 12.-13. a month is pretty high, even if I never watch it. It’s not just for that local market, but in a way so that they can cross-promote it in the States, which is the juggernaut, but then keeping that value proposition alive, you know?",

      "r1": "I believe it’s the right move, and it’s overdue. It’s an overdue divestiture. What’s being spun off is what used to be called Strategic Outsourcing Business. They changed the names a bunch of times and eventually called it infrastructure service, but what that business does is take over enterprise clients’ back-office IT function and automate and outsource IT back-office support work to India. This business' nature is very different than the rest of IBM, and it is a stable business that generates a lot of cash flows. The profitability may not be all that ideal, because it’s not as profitable as the software business, but it’s reasonably profitable, stable but low-growth. That business has been under pressure, and you saw that in the last few years’ performance of overall GTS. It was under Global Technology Service. When you have about 15-20% of the business that's low growth, low prospects but stable, it serves almost like a bolt anchor. It stabilizes you but makes it very difficult to grow faster and turn yourself into a high-growth cloud and AI and blockchain company because that business is really rooted from 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s the sunset, a little bit over-the-hill kind of business, but IBM needed them, in a way. It benefited IBM to a certain extent that it stabilized the company with stable cash flows and some profit contributions, but it definitely would not project you into the next 50 years of growth into the high-tech company that IBM wanted to be.\n\nGinni Rometty, the prior CEO, was not either courageous enough or had to deal with other political issues to make that move, although there were bankers who proposed that idea. Not until Arvin Krishna became the new CEO and basically said that, “If we truly want to realize our growth potential and become a growth company, not just a value company for value investors, we need to separate the growth part and the value part.” In a way, we are separating and spinning off the value business for the value investors who look for dividends and stability. He is trying to make the remaining IBM, combining Red Hat, the software, the cloud packs, the IBM Global Business Services, into a growth company for the growth investors. I believe that is indeed the best move over the last 5-6 years, maybe longer, strategic move.",

The important thing to know is when are those contract end dates for the largest customers. If they’re outside of that 18 months, the opportunity for disruption is pretty low because the terms of getting out of these contracts are steep penalties. Most companies, unless they can prove breach, which almost never happens, find it almost impossible to get out of these contracts during the long-term contract nature.

      "r1": "I believe it’s the right move, and it’s overdue. It’s an overdue divestiture. What’s being spun off is what used to be called Strategic Outsourcing Business. They changed the names a bunch of times and eventually called it infrastructure service, but what that business does is take over enterprise clients’ back-office IT function and automate and outsource IT back-office support work to India. This business' nature is very different than the rest of IBM, and it is a stable business that generates a lot of cash flows. The profitability may not be all that ideal, because it’s not as profitable as the software business, but it’s reasonably profitable, stable but low-growth. That business has been under pressure, and you saw that in the last few years’ performance of overall GTS. It was under Global Technology Service. When you have about 15-20% of the business that's low growth, low prospects but stable, it serves almost like a bolt anchor. It stabilizes you but makes it very difficult to grow faster and turn yourself into a high-growth cloud and AI and blockchain company because that business is really rooted from 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s the sunset, a little bit over-the-hill kind of business, but IBM needed them, in a way. It benefited IBM to a certain extent that it stabilized the company with stable cash flows and some profit contributions, but it definitely would not project you into the next 50 years of growth into the high-tech company that IBM wanted to be.\n\nGinni Rometty, the prior CEO, was not either courageous enough or had to deal with other political issues to make that move, although there were bankers who proposed that idea. Not until Arvin Krishna became the new CEO and basically said that, “If we truly want to realize our growth potential and become a growth company, not just a value company for value investors, we need to separate the growth part and the value part.” In a way, we are separating and spinning off the value business for the value investors who look for dividends and stability. He is trying to make the remaining IBM, combining Red Hat, the software, the cloud packs, the IBM Global Business Services, into a growth company for the growth investors. I believe that is indeed the best move over the last 5-6 years, maybe longer, strategic move.",

I would be introducing to the client concerns about what happens to the cloud services personnel. Are all these cloud resources going to stay with IBM, or are they going to the new company? Will there be a gap in cloud capabilities in the new company, or are those resources going along with it? Because it’s not really clear right now in the press releases, it’s pretty ripe for a competitor to come in and say, \"All cloud resources are going to stay with IBM, and so, therefore, you should be concerned because your future is in the cloud. You’re going to need cloud resources. Therefore, you should come with somebody like us that is proven in the cloud.\" That’s what the risk is here, especially to those that are 18 months before the end of their contract term. The only other thing I would mention is, with COVID, there has been a trend towards reshoring some of the capabilities, and IBM does have onshore capabilities today in this environment. They have low-cost delivery centers in Dubuque, Iowa, and Columbia, Missouri, but there are competitors like GalaxE.Solutions that are emerging competitors in this space because of the concerns with COVID, of being able to manage these offshore, large delivery centers.",

Looking at what Disney has done, like with Mulan or Raya, going Premier Access vs direct to the platform, Mulan would have been held for theatrical if possible, but given COVID, they tried Premier Access. Mulan, being very family-focused, made the cost reasonable for households. Premier Access was mostly for family films, but high-quality family films.\n\nWith Soul, it went direct-to-platform because animated films generally have lower production costs, not a lot of special effects, and lower talent costs. Soul was a family film with a great PR story, especially during COVID times, to provide high-quality content at home. It also leveraged a very relevant conversation for BLM and focusing on the African-American marketplace. Holding Black Widow allows for monetization and revenue benefits and, once theatres come back, even if only at partial capacity, releasing it can provide a great PR story and maintain a good relationship with theatrical distributors.

Customers typically start to renegotiate and look to transition about 18 months before that contract end date. The important thing to know is when are those contract end dates for the largest customers. If they’re outside of that 18 months, the opportunity for disruption is pretty low because the terms of getting out of these contracts are steep penalties. Most companies, unless they can prove breach, which almost never happens, find it almost impossible to get out of these contracts during the long-term contract nature.

A point has no barrier because you can find the locally relevant content also with Disney. They’ve done that very effectively with the TV channels they had, and now that the TV channels are merging with the streaming, there are skills, capability, expertise to be able to ramp up the local production of content to make not only a broad selection of regional content or American content or English content, but also a significant selection of locally relevant content with local talent and local language. That will give them the opportunity, like they’ve been doing with Star, to merge everything into one and be as strong as they can be internationally and locally. The know-how is definitely within the company. The only question is how much they would push. In the TV space, it was regulated by legislation which was establishing that in certain countries, to be able to broadcast, you need to have a certain amount of local productions as part of your offering. That has not been established for streaming services, but there’s a great appeal of local production for local audiences. In Europe, the benchmark was you need to have at least 30% of content produced within the European community. Will they push it to 30%? Will they do more? Will they do less? It’s up to them at this point, it’s not regulated. I wouldn’t be surprised that at some point it could be regulated, but there is the experience and the knowledge and also the evidence on how important local content is.",

      "r1": "I think they will continue to be up and down in their journey, and they have a broad portfolio. It works to their strengths and also weakness at times. It’s hard to get all the cylinders working all at the same time, but they have a lot of things to their favour. The continuing leverage, the Red Hat public cloud platform and push out, promote those cloud packs and get the IBM global services to implement those with their clients, integrate into their offerings, integrate into companies’ enterprises workflows, these are the key drivers for IBM’s growth in the future. Some traditional business, such as IBM Systems, can be a blessing and curse at different times. The hardware business for Z and Power, especially for Z, go through huge cycles. Whenever a new Z is announced every other year or so, there is a huge spike in the systems revenue, not just the Z revenue, hardware revenue, but also all the software, all the middleware, all the other services that sit upon that Z hardware platform.

If you consider the content against distribution channels, then you have to ask what was the cost of that content? How broad in terms of audience reach do I think that content can go? Looking at what Disney has done, like with Mulan or Raya, going Premier Access vs direct to the platform, Mulan would have been held for theatrical if possible, but given COVID, they tried Premier Access.

That will give them the opportunity, like they’ve been doing with Star, to merge everything into one and be as strong as they can be internationally and locally. The know-how is definitely within the company. The only question is how much they would push. In the TV space, it was regulated by legislation which was establishing that in certain countries, to be able to broadcast, you need to have a certain amount of local productions as part of your offering. That has not been established for streaming services, but there’s a great appeal of local production for local audiences. In Europe, the benchmark was you need to have at least 30% of content produced within the European community. Will they push it to 30%? Will they do more? Will they do less? It’s up to them at this point, it’s not regulated. I wouldn’t be surprised that at some point it could be regulated, but there is the experience and the knowledge and also the evidence on how important local content is.",

Marc is better only because Marc has such a passion for his service to others and a passion for philanthropy that transcends what we do as a company, and it’s a really positive message and I like having him in that leadership role to help continue to beat that drum. I never saw any particular change with Keith leaving the organisation.\n\nThe biggest risk is they completely own the segment. Their core staples, sales marketing support, are incredibly strong. As the so-called application economy continues to evolve where more and more businesses that are not in tech are writing apps. It’s not just the domain of software companies. Everybody is writing apps for their businesses. That is a threat because the platform for Salesforce is amazing for building apps that are customer-focused or CRM-focused or adjacent to customer use cases. It’s not great at something like a consumer application. You wouldn’t build TikTok on the Force platform. That’s where there is either a risk to Salesforce’s growth, is how to beat Microsoft and Amazon in that space. That’s the biggest threat to the company.",

Is there a significant need for Disney to catch up, and do you believe catching up is feasible?",
      "r1": "There's been an explosion of series being produced, both in the US and abroad. 20-25 years ago, local productions were not of the quality of US content, allowing US studios to monetize their content worldwide. However, the rest of the world has caught up in the past decade, and the US is also producing more original series for various platforms.\n\nIt's a buyer’s market, despite some content being locked up. There's too much content available, raising the question of whether it can all be sustained. The bubble has burst, partly due to COVID, with production costs rising and platforms having less money to spend, squeezing producers financially. This might lead to a shrinking similar to what's happened in retail and restaurants. The stronger conglomerates will endure, but there's concern for the middle-tier and independent producers, both domestically and internationally, and their ability to continue being viable and offering diverse voices.\n\nOn the feature film side, many types of films that were common in cinemas 10-15 years ago don't get made anymore, moving some producers to TV movies, which are now also challenged. There’s a lot of concern in the industry, with studios in the best position to endure. Disney, for example, needs content for its Disney Channel, Nat Geo channels, and Fox International Channels, alongside its SVOD services like Hulu or Star. All platforms need content, but the price point for licensing or producing content will be a key factor in the coming months into the next year.",

There's too much content available, raising the question of whether it can all be sustained. The bubble has burst, partly due to COVID, with production costs rising and platforms having less money to spend, squeezing producers financially. This might lead to a shrinking similar to what's happened in retail and restaurants. The stronger conglomerates will endure, but there's concern for the middle-tier and independent producers, both domestically and internationally, and their ability to continue being viable and offering diverse voices.\n\nOn the feature film side, many types of films that were common in cinemas 10-15 years ago don't get made anymore, moving some producers to TV movies, which are now also challenged. There’s a lot of concern in the industry, with studios in the best position to endure.

It really depends on the content, and how much of non-family-friendly content is available to Disney. That was an absolute no-go up to the launch of Disney+, and now they all end up in the same platform. At this point, the rigidity of the rules around protecting the Disney brand are now being balanced with the opportunity of expanding the Disney brand to be more inclusive of all audiences.

I wouldn’t be surprised that at some point that will happen. It really depends on the content, and how much of non-family-friendly content is available to Disney and how much they feel comfortable or uncomfortable by putting it in a platform that also has family content. That was an absolute no-go up to the launch of Disney+, to the point that Disney didn’t want to mix Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars, even if all of the Star Wars and most of the Marvel content is completely absolutely family-friendly, and now they all end up in the same platform. At this point, the rigidity of the rules around protecting the Disney brand are now being balanced with the opportunity of expanding the Disney brand to be more inclusive of all audiences.

If people who could do only one thing got themselves together and created a multi-product capability that would disrupt PayPal’s capability, that would be a threat.",

It's critical they invest in automation, both in sales and in delivery, to be successful. The losers are those that continue to play the commodity game. You've got to find some uniqueness as well, because this is a very commoditized market, and as long as you continue to play that commodity game, you’re going to be a loser from a margin in the long term. The margins have been stressed as you go offshore. There is significant turnover across this industry, especially in the offshore delivery center. If you go to India, it is not uncommon to see people with only six months of experience who hop from outsourcer to outsourcer, so the other winner has to have a labor strategy that retains people.",

Disney is also looking to monetize other parts of the company globally, especially as the ramifications of COVID ease up. The reopening of theaters at full capacity, coupled with streaming, helps recoup production costs and increases revenue streams that were lost during COVID times. Additionally, consumer products related to Disney+ series, like the Mandalorian, present opportunities for increasing revenue, including potentially airing them on Disney-owned channels with advertisements.

It will be interesting to see the analytics and subscriber and viewership outcomes from HBO Max and Peacock, despite the various challenges they may face.

Disney+ was a strategic move based on brand strength and content control. Disney+ also allows Disney to collect consumer analytics directly, similar to other platforms, which could potentially guide their future decisions.
